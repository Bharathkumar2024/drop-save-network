# Human Touch Update

## 🎯 Changes Implemented

As requested, all AI-related artifacts (specifically "Lovable" references and taggers) have been removed from the project to ensure a "Human Made" look and feel.

### 🧹 AI Items Removed
- **Lovable Meta Tags**: Removed DNS prefetch, preconnect, and OpenGraph tags pointing to `lovable.dev` from `index.html`.
- **Lovable Tagger**: Removed the component tagger plugin from `vite.config.ts` which was injecting AI helper overlays.
- **Dependencies**: Removed `lovable-tagger` from `package.json`.

### 🤝 Human Support Added
- **Footer Update**: Updated the main landing page footer to explicitly mention:
  > "Human Support Available 24/7"

The project now reflects a purely human-developed and supported identity.
